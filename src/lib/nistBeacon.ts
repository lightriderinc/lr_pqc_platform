/**
 * Fetches the latest pulse from NIST's Randomness Beacon 2.0 and mixes it
 * with fresh local randomness.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — NIST's own documentation states: "DO NOT USE BEACON GENERATED
 * VALUES AS SECRET CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS." This function honors that: the raw
 * beacon value is never used alone. It's combined with independent local
 * randomness and hashed, so the final output's security never depends on the
 * beacon value by itself — appropriate for a public/verifiable-randomness
 * display, not for generating private keys.
 *
 * Freshness check: unlike CURBy's dual-fetch comparison (appropriate there
 * because CURBy's actual pulse cadence isn't 60 seconds), NIST's beacon is
 * documented to post a new pulse every 60 seconds — fetching it twice a
 * couple seconds apart would almost always show "identical" simply because
 * no new pulse landed in that tiny window, which would be a false
 * "offline" reading, not a real one. Instead, this checks the pulse's own
 * timestamp against the current time — a much more honest signal for this
 * specific API's behavior.
